# NexGen-Intervalometer
NexGen Intervalometer 

In this repo you will find the PCB for the intervalometer and 3D print files for the case. For the firmware please check link below. The firmware is a part of a camera slider project. This firmware has been develop with polymorphism in mind. So it can be used with a variety of hardware, including a standalone intervalometer. This depending on the JSON config file that the firmware load at boot.

The firmware is availlable HERE https://github.com/cinosh07/ESP32_Camera_Slider


The interface is accessed by connecting to the Intervalometer hotspot over your mobile web browser.


This is a work in progress.
