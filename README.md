# NexGen Intervalometer

In this repo you will find the PCB for the intervalometer and 3D print files for the case. 

For the firmware please check link below. The firmware is a part of a camera slider project. This firmware has been develop with polymorphism in mind. So it can be used with a variety of hardware, including this standalone intervalometer. This is configured in the JSON config file that the firmware load at boot.

The firmware is availlable HERE https://github.com/cinosh07/ESP32_Camera_Slider

The interface is accessed by connecting to the Intervalometer hotspot over your mobile web browser.
